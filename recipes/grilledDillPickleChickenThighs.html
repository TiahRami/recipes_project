    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The next time you reach for that last pickle in the jar, hang on to the
      juice. Chicken marinated in pickle juice makes some mighty tender grilled
      chicken. The pickle flavor does not overpower, but you do need to like
      dill pickles to enjoy this.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 each skinless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups dill pickle juice</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon freeze-dried dill</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place chicken thighs in a gallon-sized resealable bag. Pour pickle juice
        over the chicken. Seal bag and refrigerate for 4 hours.
      </li>
      <li>
        Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk olive oil, seasoned salt, paprika, dill, and pepper together.

      </li>
      <li>
        Grill chicken for 6 minutes. Flip and grill until no longer pink in the
